Current Process
Access Provision:-
● The Temporary VPN access will be provided when there is an internet
issue at the site
● The Location IT engineer will initiate the request with justifications of why
the access needs to be given
● Once the Ticket has been created, the IT-Command Center Engineer will
obtain 2nd level approval from the NOC team to give Temporary VPN
Access.
● If more than 50 users seeking Temporary VPN in the same facility, the
Network Team approval should be secured.
● SLA for providing VPN access is 1 hour
Access Removing:-
● Once the Internet is stable or After 24 hours the IT engineer will
remove the access from the user profile
Proposed Solution:
if the location IT engineer initiate the request from IDAM it auto trigger the approval notification to
NOC team engineers,
Post Noc team approval the temporary VPN access would be provision to the user’s
New Solution Impact
● Manual access provisioning and deprovisioning can be time-consuming and
error-prone. Automating these processes can save time and reduce the chances
of errors, allowing IT teams to focus on other critical tasks.
● Automated access provisioning and deprovisioning can generate detailed audit
logs that can be used for compliance reporting, security analysis, and incident
investigation. These logs can help organizations identify potential security risks
and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.
